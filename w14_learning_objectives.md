# Week 14 Learning Objectives

## Basic React Objectives

### Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the "virtual DOM" to model the DOM
### Use React.createElement to create virtual DOM nodes
### Use ReactDOM.render to have React render your virtual DOM nodes into the actual Web page
### Use JSX to create virtual DOM nodes
### Describe how JSX transforms into React.createElement calls
### Use Array#map to create an array of virtual DOM nodes while specifying a unique key for each created virtual DOM node

## React Class Components Objectives
### Create a simple React application by removing items and content from a project generated by the Create ### React App default template
### Create a simple React application using a custom Create React App template
### Create a React component using ES2015 class syntax
### Describe when it's appropriate to use a class component
### Initialize and update state within a class component
### Provide default values for a class component's props
### Add event listeners to elements
### Prevent event default behavior
### Safely use the `this` keyword within event handlers
### Describe what the React `SyntheticEvent` object is and the role it plays in handling events
### Create a React class component containing a simple form
### Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple `<input>` elements
### Add a `<textarea>` element to a form
### Add a `<select>` element to a form
### Implement form validations
### Describe the lifecycle of a React component
### Recall that the commonly used component lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`
### Use the componentDidMount component lifecycle method to fetch data from an API
### Utilize official documentation to gain an understanding of how new technology works

## React Router Objectives

### Use the `react-router-dom` package to set up React Router in your applications
### Create routes using the `<Route>` component from the react-router-dom package
### Generate navigation links with the `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components from the react-router-dom package
### Create `<Switch>` routes and manage the order of rendered components
### Use the React Router `match` prop to access router parameters
### Use the React Router `history` prop to programmatically change the browser's URL
### Redirect users by using the `<Redirect>` component in a route
### Describe what nested routes are and how to create them

## React Builds Objectives

### Describe what frontend builds are and why they're needed
### Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run `npm start`
### Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment

## React Context Objectives

### Use Context to share and manage global information within a React application
### Create a wrapper component with `Context.Provider` to set a component's default context
### Create a wrapper component with `Context.Consumer` to share the global context through render props
### Create and pass a method through Context to update the global state from a nested component
