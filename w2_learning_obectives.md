# Week 2 Learning Objectives

## Running JS Locally Lesson Learning Objectives

- Match the commands `ls`, `cd`, `pwd` to their descriptions
   - `ls` lists contents of current directory
   - `cd` changes current directory
      - `cd ..` takes you up one level
      - `cd` alone takes you back home
   - `pwd` returns current directory
- Given a folder structure diagram, a list of 'cd (path)' commands and target files, match the paths to the target files.

- Use VSCode to create a folder. Within the folder create a .js file containing `console.log('hello new world');` and save it.
- Use node to execute a JavaScript file in the terminal



## Plain Old JS Object Lesson Learning Objectives

- Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference
   - primitives: strings, booleans, numbers, null and undefined
      - primitives are immutable
   - refereces: objects (including arrays)
      - references are mutable
- Identify when to use `.` vs `[]` when accessing values of an object
   - dot syntax `object.key`
      - easier to read
      - easier to write
      - cannot use variables as keys
      - keys cannot begin with a number
   - bracket notation `object["key]`
      - allows variables as keys
      - strings that start with numbers can be use as keys
- Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation
   - not clear what is meant by "interpolation"?
- Use the `obj[key] !== undefined` pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object
   - can also use `"key" in object` syntax (returns boolean)
   - keys should be unique strings
- Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function
- Iterate through an object using a `for in` loop
```javascript
let printValues = function(obj) {
   for (let key in obj) {
      let value = obj[key];
      console.log(value);
   }
}
```
- Define a function that utilizes `...rest` syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments
```javascript
let myFunction = function(str, ...strs) {
   console.log("The first string is " + str);
   console.log("The rest of the strings are:");
   strs.forEach(function(str) {
      console.log(str);
   })
}
```
- Use ...spread syntax for Object literals and Array literals
```javascript
let arr1 = ["a","b","c"];
let longer =[...arr1, "d", "e"];
```
- Destructure an array to reference specific elements
```javascript
let array = [35,9];
let [firstEl, secondEl] = array;
console.log(firstEl); // => 35
console.log(secondEl); // 9
```
- Destructure an object to reference specific values
   - rule of thumb—only destructure values from objects that are two levels deep
```javascript
// with variable names that match keys
let obj = {name: "Wilfred", appearance: ["short", "mustache"]}
let { name, appearance } = obj;
console.log(name); // "Wilfred"
console.log(appearance); // ["short", "mustache"]

// with new variable names
let {name: myName, appearance: myAppearance} = obj;

console.log(myName); // "Wilfred"
console.log(myAppearance); // ["short", "mustache"]

// in a function call
let sayHello = function({name}) {
   console.log("Hello, " + name); // "Hello Wilfred"
}

```
- Write a function that accepts a array as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array
```javascript
let countedChars = function(arr) {
   let obj = {};
   arr.forEach(function(elem, ind) {
      // wasn't sure exacely what they meant by "count"
      // so i'm using index instead
      obj[elem] = ind;
   })
   return obj;
}
```


## Pair Programming Lesson Learning Objectives
Below is a complete list of the terminal learning objectives for this lesson. When you complete this lesson, you should be able to perform each of the following objectives. These objectives capture how you may be evaluated on the assessment for this lesson.

- Differentiate between the "Driver" and "Navigator" roles in a pair programming session.
   - driver is typing, according to navigator's directions
   - navigator is planning what gets typed and watching for errors
- Describe at least three benefits of effective pair programming.
   - can be more efficient—not the programming itself, but the debugging
   - less "lonely"—not just good emotionally, but unlikely to get bogged down or stuck
   - pair programmers are good communicators—can be useful in any teamwork context, as well as in interviews
- Demonstrate empathetic communication and be able to explain the meaning of "You are not your code".
   - apply criticism to the code—specifically what's happening, what's not working, rather than to what the person did wrong
   - "code-centric" focuses on outcomes and looks toward improvement, instead of assigning blame and enumerating negative consequences
   - emphasizes the team-based nature of success and failure
- Identify negative interactions during a pair programming session.
- Identify the exact steps of a/A's pair programming process.
   - partner up—new partner each time
   - check in
      - what are you pairing on?
      - for how long?
      - any appointments/scheduling conflicts?
      - assign starting driver & navigator
   - get coding
      - driver shares screen
      - pause timer for extended discussion/research
   - hand off
      - swap driver and navigator every 15 minutes
   - follow-up
      - recap accomplishments, what's left to do, leave notes about where you left off
- Describe the importance of pair programming competency while interviewing for jobs.
   - you may be expected to pair program/collaborate during job interviews
   - also improves communication about programming while doing it


## Callbacks Lesson Learning Objectives


- Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called “First Class Objects” in JavaScript.
   - they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and serve as return value for a function
   - supports same basic operations as other types (strings, bools, numbers)
   - higher-order functions take functions as arguments or return functions as values
- Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple `console.log`s, predict what will be printed
- Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater.
```javascript
let greaterCB = function(val, callback1, callback2) {
   if (callback1(val) > callback2(val)) {
      return callback1(val);
   }
   return callback2(val);
}
```
- Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#map`.
```javascript
let myMap = function(array, callback) {
   let newArr = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
      mapped = callback(array[i]);
      newArr.push(mapped);
   }
   return newArr;
}
```
- Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#filter`.
```javascript
let myFilter = function(array, callback) {
   let filtered = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
      if (callback(array[i])) {
         filtered.push(array[i]);
      }
   }
 }
```
- Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#every`.
```javascript
let myEvery = function(array, callback) {
   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
      if (!callback(array[i])) {
         return false
      }
   }
   return true;
}
```



## Scope Lesson Learning Objectives

- Identify the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations
   - `const` - cannot reassign variable, scoped to block
   - `let` - can reassign variable, scoped to block
   - `var` - outdated, may or may not be reassigned, scoped to function
   - variables always evaluate to value it contains regardless of how it was declared
- Explain the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations
   - `var` is function scoped—so if you declare it anywhere in a function, the declaration (but not assignement) is "hoisted"
      - so it will exist in memory as "undefined" which seems bad and unpredictable
      - `var` will also allow you to redeclare a variable, while let will raise a syntax error. you shouldn't be able to do that!
      - `const` won't let you reassign a variable, but if it points to a mutable object, you will still be able to change the value by mutating the object
      - block-scoped variables allow new variables with the same name in new scopes
      - block-scoped still performs hoisting of all variables within the block, but it doesn't initialize to the value of `undefined` like `var` does, so it throws a specific reference error if you try to access the value before it has been declared
      - if you do not use `var` or `let` or `const` when initializing, it will be declared as global—THIS IS BAD
- Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining
   - scope of a program means the set of variables that are available for use within the program
   - global scope is represented by the `window` object in the browser and the `global` object in Node.js
      - global variables are available everywhere, and so increase the risk of name collisions
   - local scope is the set of variables available for use within the function
      - when we enter a function, we enter a new scope
      - includes functions arguments, local variables declared inside function, and any variables that were already declared when the function is defined (hmm about that last one)
   - for blocks (denoted by curly braces `{}`, as in conditionals or `for` loops), variables can be block scoped
   - inner scope does not have access to variables in the outer scope
      - scope chaining—if a given cariable is not found in immediate scope, javascript will search all accessible outer scopes until variable is found
      - so an inner scope can access outer scope variables
      - but an outer scope can never access inner scope variables
- Define an arrow function
- Given an arrow function, deduce the value of `this` without executing the code
- Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope
   - a closure is " the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared"
      - alternatively, "when an inner function uses or changes variables in an outer function"
   - closures have access to any variables within their own scope + scope of outer functions + global scope — the set of all these available variables is "lexical environemnt"
   - closure keeps reference to all variables **even if the outer function has return**
      - each function has a private mutable state that cannot be accessed externally
      - if you call the same function more than once, you are not totally starting with a blank slate necessarily?
      - closures can allow you to pass down arguments to helper functions without explicitly passing them to that helper function

```javascript
// what the hell
// i need to think about this
function createCounter() {
   // in this function i am making a function that
   // starts a new counter at 0
   // but when you use this function to create that new counter,
   // each new counter you create will have the same, like
   // internal state everytime it's accessed
   // you can't access that state from outside of the function
   let count = 0;
   return function() {
      count ++;
      return count;
   }
}

let counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); //=> 1
console.log(counter()); //=> 2
// so counter variable is a closure, in that
// it contains the inner count value that was
// initialized by the outer createCounter() function
// count has been captured or closed over

// this state is private, so if i run createCounter again
// i get a totally separate count that doesn't interact
// with the previous one and each of the new functions
// will have their own internal state based on the
// initial declaration in the now-closed outer function

let counter2 = createCounter();
console.log(counter2()); // => 1

// okay but what if i set one function equal to the other?
// does it get the old one's internal state/closure?

let counter3 = counter2;
console.log(counter3()); //=>
// so yeah i think this fundamentally speaks to the
// i dunno - mutability of the functions?
// functions are a reference? maybe this is connected?
// when you pass a function around you are passing
// around the whole closure
// lmao
```
- Define a method that references `this` on an object literal
- Utilize the built in `Function#bind` on a callback to maintain the context of this
- Given a code snippet, identify what `this` refers to
