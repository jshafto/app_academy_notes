# Week 6 Learning Objectives

## HTTP
### The objective of this lesson is for you to get comfortable with the main concepts of HTTP.
HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web. It's essential knowledge for developers who work with the web. At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to
- identify common HTTP verbs and status codes
- demonstrate how HTTP is used by setting up a simple server.
- match the header fields of HTTP with a bank of definitions.
- match HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE) to their common uses.
- match common HTTP status codes (200, 302, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 500) to their meanings.
- send a simple HTTP request to `google.com`
- write a very simple HTTP server using ‘http’ in node with paths that will result in the common HTTP status codes.

## Promises Lesson Learning Objectives I

### Instantiate a `Promise` object
### Use `Promises` to write more maintainable asynchronous code
### Use the `fetch` API to make `Promise`-based API calls

## Promises Lesson Learning Objectives II

### Use `async`/`await` with promise-based functions to write asynchrnous code that behaves synchronously.


## HTML Learning Objectives

    - thead
    - tbody
    - tfoot
    - tr
    - th
    - td

## Testing
### Explain the "red-green-refactor" loop of test-driven development.
### Identify the definitions of SyntaxError, ReferenceError, and TypeError
### Create, modify, and get to pass a suite of Mocha tests
### Use Chai to structure your tests using behavior-driven development principles.
### Use the pre- and post-test hooks provided by Mocha
