# Week 11 Learning Objectives

## Regular Expressions Objectives
### Define the effect of the * operator and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the ? operator and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the + operator and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the . operator and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the ^ operator and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the $ operator and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the [] bracket expression and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the - inside brackets and use it in a regular expression
### Define the effect of the ^ inside brackets and use it in a regular expression

## HTTP Full-Stack Objectives
### Identify the five parts of a URL
### Identify at least three protocols handled by the browser
### Use an `IncomingMessage` object to
#### access the headers sent by a client (like a Web browser) as part of the HTTP request
#### access the HTTP method of the request
#### access the path of the request
#### access and read the stream of content for requests that have a body
### Use a `ServerResponse` object to
#### write the status code, message, and headers for an HTTP response
#### write the content of the body of the response
#### properly end the response to indicate to the client (like a Web browser) that all content has been written

## Express Objectives
### Send plain text responses for any HTTP request
### Use pattern matching to match HTTP request paths to route handlers
### Use the Pug template engine to generate HTML from Pug templates to send to the browser
### Pass data to Pug templates to generate dynamic content
### Use the `Router` class to modularize the definition of routes

## Pug Template Objectives
### Declare HTML tags and their associated ids, classes, attributes, and content
### Use conditional statements to determine whether or not to render a block
### Use interpolation to mix static text and dynamic values in content and attributes
### Use iteration to generate multiple blocks of HTML based on data provided to the template

## HTML Forms Objectives
### Describe the interaction between the client and server when an HTML form is loaded into the browser, the user submits it, and the server processes it
### Create an HTML form using the Pug template engine
### Use express to handle a form's POST request
### Use the built-in `express.urlencoded()` middleware function to parse incoming request body form data
### Explain what data validation is and why it's necessary for the server to validate incoming data
### Validate user-provided data from within an Express route handler function
### Write a custom middleware function that validates user-provided data
### Use the `csurf` middleware to embed a token value in forms to protect against Cross-Site ### Request Forgery exploits

## Data-Driven Websites Objectives
### Use environment variables to specify configuration of or provide sensitive information for your code
### Use the `dotenv` npm package to load environment variables defined in an `.env` file
### Recall that Express cannot process unhandled Promise rejections from within route handler (or middleware) functions;
### Use a Promise `catch` block or a `try`/`catch` statement with `async`/`await` to properly handle errors thrown from within an asynchronous route handler (or middleware) function
### Write a wrapper function to simplify catching errors thrown within asynchronous route handler (or middleware) functions
### Use the `morgan` npm package to log requests to the terminal window to assist with auditing and debugging
### Add support for the Bootstrap front-end component library to a Pug layout template
### Install and configure Sequelize within an Express application.
### Use Sequelize to test the connection to a database before starting the HTTP server on application startup
### Define a collection of routes (and views) that perform CRUD operations against a single resource using Sequelize
### Handle Sequelize validation errors when users are attempting to create or update data and display error messages to the user so that they can resolve any data quality issues
### Describe how an Express.js error handler function differs from middleware and route handler functions
### Define a global Express.js error-handling function to catch and process unhandled errors
### Define a middleware function to handle requests for unknown routes by returning a 404 NOT FOUND error
